    <Description>
        An open source SRD 5.1 library in C#. It aims to implement most of the rules of the 5.1 SRD 
        with zero dependencies other than the .NET framework itself. Very few modern .NET framework features are used, 
        in order to maximize portability.
        The library contains races, classes, equipment, skills, feats, spells and game mechanics from the official SRD5. 
        Please note, particularly for skills and spellsl that while the library contains all entries from the SRD5, 
        not all of them have a useful implementation. For example, it is perfectly possible to have a character
        prepare and cast a "Thaumaturgy" cantrip. The library will not, however, provide you the semantics of what happens
        in your game when  "Your voice booms up to three times as loud as normal for 1 minute". On the other hand, when a 
        character or monster casts a "Magic Missile" spell, the library will correctly determine whether the target is in 
        range, and how much damage it takes, if any.
